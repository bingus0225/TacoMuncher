        <h2><u>Personal Life</u></h2>
        <p>I attend GCM High School in Baytown, Tx.</p>
            <p>Throughout my life ive experienced being bullied and ive grown up in a decent home environment, ive always had some form of support during my lowest points in life.<br>
                Although bullying was hell for me, after a while of constant bullying without being able to speak up from how shy i was, i was relieved when it had stopped<br>
                All of those who bullied me in middle school had switched schools and the relief of all the stress of being clowned daily was gone.</p>
            <p>My closest friends have always been there when i needed help and couldnt build up courage to tell an adult. they were there to help me during suicidal thoughts and relationships.<br>
            I truly cant thank them enough for being there at my lowest.</p>
