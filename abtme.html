            <h4><u>Why I code</u></h4>
            <p>I started programming in late 2022 in my 8th grade year
            I wanted something I could work on as a hobby, which quickly turned into a passion that I wish to major in college with.<br>
            I've had 2 previous websites that I took down since I had lost the source code, I then made this website as something to mess around on.<br>
            As I learn more and more code i'll add more and make it professional, 
            so that if I get into computer science later in college, i'll have a self-taught fully programmed site.</p>

            <h4><u>My future plans</u></h4>
            <p>As mentioned in the near future I wish to graduate high school and pursue a major in computer science at Texas A&M
            and graduate with a Bachelors degree.<br>
            Although I have spent 2 years learning HTML, CSS, and JS; I have only learned the basics
            and still know very little of JS, once I get into college I hope to learn different languages with in-depth
            explanations.<br>Some languages I wish to learn are C++, Python, and PHP</p>

            <h4>My idea about quantum immortality</h4>
            <p>Last year, I took around a year reading about how quantum physics could be applied to immortality.
            After I took a few months to write how someone could witness one's death occur every few minutes, but you would only see
            a continuous existence, keeping your soul alive and branching into parallel universes; your conciousness would see
            only the timeline when you lived.</p>
